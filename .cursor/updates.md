# Path Resolution and Module Import Refactoring

## Changes Made

1. Added Path Resolution Utilities
   - Created new `src/paths.ts` module for centralized path resolution
   - Added helper functions: `resolveRoot`, `resolveSrc`, `resolveBuild`
   - Eliminated use of complex `__dirname` and `import.meta.url` path resolution

2. TypeScript Configuration Updates
   - Updated `tsconfig.json` to use `NodeNext` module resolution
   - Added `baseUrl` and `paths` configuration for better import handling
   - Configured path aliases for cleaner imports

3. Import Statement Standardization
   - Standardized import paths across all files
   - Removed complex path traversal using `path.dirname`
   - Updated to use consistent `.js` extensions for ES modules

4. File-specific Changes

   a. template-builder.ts:
      - Simplified root directory resolution
      - Updated path handling to use new utility functions
      - Fixed import statements

   b. agent.ts:
      - Simplified .cursor directory path resolution
      - Updated to use new path utilities
      - Fixed import statements

   c. init_cursor.ts:
      - Simplified template directory path resolution
      - Updated to use new path utilities
      - Fixed import statements

   d. screenshot.ts:
      - Updated to use fs/promises consistently
      - Added path resolution utility
      - Fixed import statements

5. Build Process
   - Verified successful build with all changes
   - Ensured proper file copying to build directory
   - Maintained all existing functionality

## Benefits

1. Improved Path Resolution
   - More reliable path resolution across different environments
   - Eliminated complex path traversal logic
   - Centralized path handling in one location

2. Better Module Resolution
   - Cleaner import statements
   - Consistent use of file extensions
   - Better TypeScript integration

3. Enhanced Maintainability
   - Reduced code complexity
   - More consistent codebase
   - Better error handling for file operations

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding path resolution tests
2. Document path resolution patterns in README
3. Consider adding path validation utilities
4. Monitor for any path-related issues in production use
