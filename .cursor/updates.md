# Path Resolution and Module Import Refactoring

## Changes Made

1. Added Path Resolution Utilities
   - Created new `src/paths.ts` module for centralized path resolution
   - Added helper functions: `resolveRoot`, `resolveSrc`, `resolveBuild`
   - Eliminated use of complex `__dirname` and `import.meta.url` path resolution

2. TypeScript Configuration Updates
   - Updated `tsconfig.json` to use `NodeNext` module resolution
   - Added `baseUrl` and `paths` configuration for better import handling
   - Configured path aliases for cleaner imports

3. Import Statement Standardization
   - Standardized import paths across all files
   - Removed complex path traversal using `path.dirname`
   - Updated to use consistent `.js` extensions for ES modules

4. File-specific Changes

   a. template-builder.ts:
      - Simplified root directory resolution
      - Updated path handling to use new utility functions
      - Fixed import statements

   b. agent.ts:
      - Simplified .cursor directory path resolution
      - Updated to use new path utilities
      - Fixed import statements

   c. init_cursor.ts:
      - Simplified template directory path resolution
      - Updated to use new path utilities
      - Fixed import statements

   d. screenshot.ts:
      - Updated to use fs/promises consistently
      - Added path resolution utility
      - Fixed import statements

5. Build Process
   - Verified successful build with all changes
   - Ensured proper file copying to build directory
   - Maintained all existing functionality

## Benefits

1. Improved Path Resolution
   - More reliable path resolution across different environments
   - Eliminated complex path traversal logic
   - Centralized path handling in one location

2. Better Module Resolution
   - Cleaner import statements
   - Consistent use of file extensions
   - Better TypeScript integration

3. Enhanced Maintainability
   - Reduced code complexity
   - More consistent codebase
   - Better error handling for file operations

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding path resolution tests
2. Document path resolution patterns in README
3. Consider adding path validation utilities
4. Monitor for any path-related issues in production use

# Added Engineer Role to Agent Task Tool

Added a new "engineer" role to the agent_task tool that specializes in methodically implementing tasks created by architect and designer roles, with a focus on thorough task tracking and high-quality code without redundant work.

1. Core Changes
   - Added 'engineer' to AgentType enum in types/template.ts
   - Created comprehensive engineer configuration with specialized prompts and instructions
   - Updated AgentTaskToolSchema to support the new role
   - Ensured build system properly handles the new agent type

2. Documentation Updates
   - Updated README.md to describe the engineer role
   - Updated rules.md to include guidance on when to use the engineer role
   - Updated cursor-template rules.md for new projects

3. Configuration Enhancements
   - Created detailed system prompt for the engineer role
   - Added task tracking focused implementation instructions
   - Updated version to 2.0.2 to reflect the new capability

4. Benefits
   - More thorough implementation of complex tasks
   - Better tracking of task completion status
   - Reduced redundant work and circular implementations
   - Higher quality code with better error handling and edge case coverage
   
5. Next Steps
   - Add additional templates for engineer role
   - Enhance task tracking capabilities
   - Consider adding automated testing of implementations

# Engineer Role Implementation Progress

Added core functionality for the new engineer role to the agent_task tool:

1. Core Components
   - Created engineer configuration with specialized prompts and instructions
   - Added engineer template to cursor-template/agent-templates
   - Enhanced error handling for engineer-specific requirements
   - Updated schema validation with clear error messages

2. Documentation Updates
   - Enhanced README with detailed description of engineer role capabilities
   - Updated rules.md with instructions for using the engineer role
   - Created detailed task tracking for the implementation process

3. Integration
   - Updated AgentTaskToolSchema to support the engineer role
   - Updated the MCP tool definition in index.ts with proper role validation
   - Built and verified the implementation works without errors

The engineer role is designed to methodically implement tasks created by architect and designer roles while tracking progress, preventing redundant work, and ensuring high-quality code with proper error handling. The next steps are to reload the MCP server and create a PR to merge these changes to main.

# Task Structure Refactoring

Refactored task storage to use a more organized directory structure:

1. New Directory Structure
   - Created .cursor/tasks/ directory to store agent-specific task files
   - Implemented separate files for each agent type (.cursor/tasks/{architect,designer,engineer}.md)
   - Updated agent_task.ts to save tasks to the appropriate file based on agent type

2. Migration Strategy
   - Added backward compatibility by maintaining the legacy tasks.md file
   - Added redirect notice to help users find the new task files
   - Ensured seamless transition for existing projects

3. Template Updates
   - Modified init_cursor.ts to create the task directory structure in new projects
   - Added placeholder files for each agent type
   - Updated documentation in rules.md to reflect the new structure

4. Benefits
   - Clear separation of concerns between different agent types
   - Prevention of task overlap and confusion
   - Better organization for complex projects with multiple agent roles
   - Improved maintainability and readability of task files

This refactoring complements the engineer role implementation by providing a more structured approach to task management, aligning with the engineer's focus on methodical task tracking and comprehensive implementation.
