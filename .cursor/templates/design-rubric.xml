<DESIGN RUBRIC>
| Category | Description | A | B | C | D | F |
|----------|------------|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Color Palette** | Weight: 1x | Colors are masterfully integrated, perfectly reflecting the brand and balancing contrast for optimal usability. | Colors are thoughtfully selected, support brand identity, and maintain a mostly consistent visual hierarchy. | A serviceable color scheme is present, though minor inconsistencies or contrast issues reduce overall effectiveness. | Colors are partially aligned with the brand but fail to follow best practices in contrast or hierarchy. | Colors are chosen at random, creating visual confusion and lacking any cohesive theme or brand alignment. |
| **Layout & Grid** | Weight: 1x | Grid usage is expertly executed, ensuring balanced spacing, alignment consistency, and a crisp, professional structure. | A purposeful grid strategy creates a cohesive layout; minor alignment or spacing issues may still be noticed. | Layout generally follows a grid, though some elements deviate; overall structure is acceptable but not optimal. | Some grid principles are followed, but spacing is inconsistent and visual alignment suffers in key sections. | No clear structure or grid system in place, resulting in a disorganized and hard-to-navigate layout. |
| **Typography** | Weight: 1x | Typography is outstanding, with well-chosen fonts, impeccable kerning, and a clean hierarchy that enhances user engagement. | Typography choices reflect a solid visual hierarchy and balanced kerning; minor refinements may further improve readability. | Typography is functional with moderately consistent styles, though headlines, body text, and spacing could be refined. | Font selection is somewhat appropriate but lacks clear organization; kerning and leading inconsistencies persist. | Font choices are erratic or unreadable, with rampant inconsistencies in size, weight, or familial styles. |
| **Hierarchy & Navigation** | Weight: 1x | Flawless content hierarchy with intuitive navigation that effortlessly guides users to core features and information. | Content levels are well-defined, and primary navigation is accessible; minor tweaks could enhance usability further. | A straightforward hierarchy is established, though key actions or navigation items could be more prominently displayed. | Some attempt at prioritizing content is visible, yet users may struggle to locate important features easily. | Information is scattered without clear importance levels; navigation elements are unrecognizable or absent. |
| **Accessibility** | Weight: 1x | Fully meets or exceeds accessibility best practices, ensuring all users can easily interact with and understand the dashboard. | The design largely complies with accessibility standards; minor improvements could include more robust testing or refinements. | Basic accessibility measures are present, though certain features like keyboard navigation or ARIA tags may be incomplete. | Some attempts to address accessibility are made, yet many crucial guidelines (e.g., color contrast) remain unmet. | Design disregards accessibility guidelines altogether, using low contrast, illegible fonts, and no accessible patterns. |
| **Spacing & Alignment** | Weight: 1x | A perfectly balanced layout with deliberate spacing; every element is precisely aligned for maximum readability. | Thoughtful use of white space and alignment creates a clean layout with only minor areas needing adjustment. | Spacing and alignment are mostly consistent, though certain sections need refinement to enhance clarity. | Some uniformity in spacing is emerging, but inconsistent alignment detracts from legibility and overall visual flow. | Visual clutter dominates due to no consistent margins, padding, or alignment, making the interface look unfinished. |

<INSTRUCTIONS>
Act as a world-class designer. Your job is to take this prototype and turn it into a impeccably designed web application. This application should be in the top 1% of well designed applications and should be a winner of an Apple design award. Use the <RUBRIC> as a guide and do not complete this task until you score an A in every category. Output your design tasks as a series of very specific actions a front-end designer should take to implement this design. Each task should be one story point, and include the specific filenames to update. Your output should be a detailed, numbered markdown checklist with each task unchecked. 
Include instructions at the top of your output that tell the agent how to use the output:
"It is critical that you do not skip any steps. After you complete each task, update the file to check off any task. Run builds and commits after each task. Continue with each task until you have checked off each one. After each story, do not take a screenshot. If you need more detail about a task, you can gather relevant files and pass the FULL file to the research agent."
