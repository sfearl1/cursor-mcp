1. **Update the `AgentType` Enum in `types/template.ts`**
   - [ ] Locate `types/template.ts` and find the `AgentType` enum definition.
   - [ ] Add a new enum item called `Engineer` to represent the new role.
   - **Rationale**: Incorporating the Engineer role in the enumeration allows the system to distinguish this new type of agent.
   - **Impact**: This change impacts areas of the code that utilize the `AgentType` enum by introducing a new valid option.

2. **Create Templates for the Engineer Role**
   - [ ] Add a new XML file named `engineer.xml` in the directory `src/cursor-template/agent-templates/` for the Engineer role.
   - [ ] Define the necessary XML structure that outlines the basic template for tasks specific to the Engineer role.
   - **Rationale**: Templates provide a standardized approach for new tasks implemented by the Engineer role.
   - **Impact**: This step will create a new file, and its usage needs to be defined in any system configuration or documentation regarding agent templates.

3. **Modify the Agent Task Implementation**
   - [ ] Open `src/tools/agent_task.ts`.
   - [ ] Within the main function, implement conditional logic to handle task assignments based on the `Engineer` role.
   - [ ] Ensure that the implementation includes task tracking and the updating of tasks as they are completed.
   - **Rationale**: Extending the `agent_task.ts` file to support the Engineer role allows the system to process this role's operations effectively.
   - **Impact**: Coding quality and task tracking by the Engineer will affect task flow and dependencies in other tools like `architect` and `designer`.

4. **Enhance System Prompts for the Engineer Role**
   - [ ] Modify or add new system prompts in `src/tools/agent_task.ts` that are specific to interactions with the Engineer role tasks.
   - [ ] Ensure prompts guide the Engineer through task verification, and code quality checks to avoid redundancy and circular implementations.
   - **Rationale**: Clear and specific prompts will guide the Engineer in executing tasks accurately and efficiently.
   - **Impact**: Changes in prompts will directly affect how users interact with the Engineer functionalities and can influence user experience and efficiency of task completion.

5. **Implement Task Tracking Functionality**
   - [ ] Create a new function in `src/utils/shared.ts` named `trackTaskProgress`.
   - [ ] This function should accept task identifiers and status updates, and then log these changes in a `tasks.md` file.
   - **Rationale**: Tracking task progress is vital for the new Engineer role to manage its workload and completion rate effectively.
   - **Impact**: Adding this functionality will introduce more IO operations and can affect performance depending on task frequency and system capabilities.

6. **Build and Commit Changes**
   - [ ] Run a build to compile the changes: `npm run build`.
   - [ ] If the build passes without errors, update the `.cursor/updates.md` with a summary of changes: "Added Engineer role support in Agent Tasks and implemented task tracking."
   - [ ] Stage and commit all changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Implement Engineer role support and task tracking."`.
   
By following this plan, the new Engineer role will be correctly integrated into the system, enhancing the platform's capability to handle more structured and systematic task executions.
