1. **Analyze Codebase for Path Resolution**

   - [x] Use the `read_multiple_files` tool to read `src/paths.ts`, `src/index.ts`, and all relevant JavaScript and TypeScript files in the `src` directory that might deal with imports or require statements to check if path resolution changes have been implemented correctly.

2. **Verify and Update Import Statements**

   - [x] In file `src/paths.ts`:
     - Check if paths are defined using absolute or relative paths.
     - Modify paths to use absolute paths for clearer and more reliable path resolution.
     - **Rationale:** Absolute paths prevent issues related to relative paths when modules are moved or refactored.
     - **Impact:** This modification ensures path resolution consistency across the codebase.

   - [x] In all files under `src` that have imports:
     - Replace all relative path imports with the updated paths from `src/paths.ts`.
     - For each update, ensure imports are sorted according to the guideline: external → internal → sibling → styles.
     - **Rationale:** Consistent use of the defined paths in `src/paths.ts` enhances maintenance and readability.
     - **Impact:** Changes in how paths are defined in `src/paths.ts` can affect imports throughout the project.

3. **Refactor Code for Path Utilization**

   - [x] In file `src/index.ts`:
     - Update the file to utilize the new absolute paths for importing necessary modules or components.
     - Ensure all path-related operations support the use of these new path configurations.
     - **Rationale:** Ensures that the entry point of the application aligns with path resolution configurations.
     - **Impact:** Major impact on how the application initializes and loads modules.

4. **Configuration Update in `tsconfig.json`**

   - [x] Modify `tsconfig.json` to include or update the `baseUrl` and `paths` configurations to support absolute paths.
     - Set `"baseUrl": "./src"`.
     - Configure paths that reflect the structure of the project for clearer resolution.
     - **Rationale:** Configuring TypeScript to recognize the base URL and paths helps in simplifying imports and maintaining consistency.
     - **Impact:** Direct impact on how TypeScript resolves modules, therefore affecting the build process and potentially the runtime module resolution.

5. **Build and Commit**

   - [x] Run a build to ensure all changes compile correctly using command `npm run build`.
     - **Rationale:** Validates that the changes made do not introduce errors and are compatible with the rest of the codebase.
     - **Impact:** Confirmation that the application is still functional after the modifications.

   - [x] Document changes in `.cursor/updates.md`:
     - Add a summary explaining the updates made to path resolution and import structuring.
     - **Rationale:** Provides documentation for future reference and clarity on what changes were made during this operation.

   - [x] Use `git add . && git commit -m "Refactor path resolution and update import structures for enhanced reliability."`
     - **Rationale:** Version control update to save the changes made.
     - **Impact:** Maintains a historical record of the changes and ensures they are tracked in version control.
