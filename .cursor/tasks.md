1. **Identify files prone to path resolution issues**
   - [ ] Read all file contents under `src/` using the Filesystem MCP Tool `read_multiple_files` to identify all import/export statements. Focus on `src/helpers/template-builder.ts, src/tools/agent.ts, src/tools/code_review.ts, src/tools/init_cursor.ts, src/tools/screenshot.ts, src/index.ts` due to their dependencies.
    - **Rationale:** Ensuring that all relevant import/export paths are accounted for avoids runtime errors from unresolved paths and maintains modular structure.

2. **Analyze import/export paths**
   - [ ] Search for any non-relative paths and paths that do not use kebab-case naming as per the stated rules.
   - [ ] List all files with potential path issues to be refactored.
   - **Rationale:** Incorrect path naming can lead to module resolution failures and does not comply with the project’s naming conventions, potentially affecting the build process.

3. **Refactor file paths and names**
   - [ ] Update all identified non-relative and incorrectly cased paths in the `src/` files listed. Ensure that the paths use relative file referencing and adhere to kebab-case naming conventions.
   - **Rationale:** This ensures compliance with existing coding standards and improves code maintainability and readability.

4. **Modify TypeScript configuration**
   - [ ] Open `tsconfig.json` and ensure that `baseUrl` and `paths` are configured to aid in module resolution.
   - [ ] If not appropriately set, configure `baseUrl` to "./src" and set common paths to include shortcuts for deep imports.
   - **Rationale:** Configuring TypeScript’s compiler options improves module resolution and import efficiency, reducing potential path resolution issues.

5. **Optimize import statements**
   - [ ] In impacted files, organize and sort import statements: external first, then internal modules, followed by sibling imports and style imports.
   - **Rationale:** Well-organized imports improve code readability and help prevent circular dependencies.

6. **Update usage of absolute imports to relative imports**
   - [ ] Fix any absolute imports in the `src/` directory files to use relative imports, enhancing portability and dependency tracking.
   - **Rationale:** Reducing reliance on project-specific or absolute paths increases the reusability and maintainability of modules.

7. **Check and reinforce TypeScript types usage**
   - [ ] Scan through `src/types/template.ts` along with other touched TypeScript files to ensure explicit typing is used and that the TypeScript strict mode is respected without using `any` type.
   - **Rationale:** Enforcing strict typing aids in identifying potential bugs at compile-time rather than runtime.

8. **Build the project**
   - [ ] Run the command `npm run build` to build the project, ensuring all changes do not introduce errors.
   - **Rationale:** Building the project confirms that all refactorings work as expected without causing new issues.

9. **Document changes**
   - [ ] Add a summary of the changes to `.cursor/updates.md`. Mention the refactoring performed on module resolution and path normalization in the repository.
   - **Rationale:** Documentation provides a concise reference to changes made during development that can be particularly useful during project reviews or audits.

10. **Prepare the codebase for a commit**
    - [ ] Execute the command `git add . && git commit -m "Refactor path resolution and module imports to align with best practices"` to stage all changes and commit them with a descriptive message.
    - **Rationale:** This step safely secures the changes in version control, making sure all refactoring work is preserved and noted under proper versioning norms.
